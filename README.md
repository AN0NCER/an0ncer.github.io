I keep making news slider (trailers). The functionality will include:

- Trailer data (video, audio, id, anime, image)
- Direct inclusion of video + audio from google server
- Additional **`YT.Player`** library if there are problems with the main server

This list of trailers will be changed every Sunday. To do this, I am writing a node js and python script that will select the actual trailers of this week.

All changes are in another branch (**main-page**)
